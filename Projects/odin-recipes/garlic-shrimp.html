        <mark>Disclaimer:</mark> Garlic Noodles with Shrimp is not an authentic
        Asian recipe. It calls for Asian ingredients, along with western
        ingredients such as butter and spaghetti noodles. ðŸ™‚ It calls for a lot
        of very classic Asian ingredients like fish sauce and oyster sauce, so
        it still reminds me of noodle I had growing up in Asia, but with a
        slight twist. Regardless, it is VERY DELICIOUS, and addictive, and trust
        me, you will want seconds once you get a taste of my Garlic Noodles with
        Shrimp.

        <mark>Description:</mark> ðŸ˜‹This is an Asian inspired Shrimp Garlic
        Noodle recipe where chewy spaghetti noodles (or any noodles really) is
        tossed in a garlic butter sauce with savory umami Asian inspired
        flavors. Juicy seared shrimp compliments it perfectly, bringing some
        additional flavor and texture to the dish. Flavorful is an
        understatement when it comes to describing this dish. The flavors are
        unique, distinct, and will have you coming back for more.
