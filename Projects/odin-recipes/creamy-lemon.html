    <h1>Creamy lemon Chicken Pasta:</h1>

        <img src="resources/Creamy-Lemon.jpg" alt="Picture of the Recipe" />
        <p>
            <mark>Disclaimer:</mark> Think of this as the creamier, more hearty version of the previous lemon pasta dish. It has the added touch of cream
            (half and half, to be exact) and juicy seasoned chicken pieces tossed along with it.
            Note 1: <br>If setting aside noodles for a while, toss in olive oil to prevent noodles from sticking together.
            Note 2: <br>Warm half and half in the microwave before adding to the skillet to avoid curdling. Whisking the liquid in the
            skillet constantly while pouring will also be help in preventing curdling.

            <mark>Description:</mark> ðŸ˜‹Creamy Lemon Chicken Pasta is the epitome of Spring time food - light, zesty, and a burst of freshness in every bite!
            
            What you are looking at: al-dente linguini noodles tossed in buttery lemon garlic cream sauce that happens to also be

                <li>
                    Bring water to boil in a pot and cook linguini noodles according to package instructions. Drain when noodles are done
                    and set aside (see Note 1).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cube chicken tenderloins. Coat chicken pieces with a few pinches of salt and black pepper.
                </li>
                <li>
                Heat skillet with 1 tbsp of unsalted butter. Once butter is melted (before it turns brown), add chicken tenderloins.</li>
                <li>
                    Sear chicken under medium high heat until they are slightly brown on the outside and cooked on the insides. Remove
                    chicken and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>Add the rest of the butter to skillet, and scrap the bottom of the skillet to remove any brown bits so it is
                incorporated into the butter. Add garlic, and stir for 10-20 seconds or until fragrant (before they turn brown).</li>
                <li>Add lemon juice and lemon zest, stir. Then slowly add half and half (make sure it is in room temperature or warm, see
                Note 2) while stirring constantly. Bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Lower heat to medium and add parmesan cheese. Stir to incorporate parmesan into the sauce.</li>
                <li>Turn heat off. Bring linguini and chicken pieces back to skillet. Toss to coat pasta and chicken in sauce. Taste and add
                salt and black pepper to taste to open up the flavors even more.</li>
                <li>Serve with more parmesan cheese and chopped parsley if desire. Enjoy!</li>
